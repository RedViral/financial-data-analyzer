This code is aimed at finding patterns in financial data series using Artificial Neural Networks. It is packaged into a dll and trained on historical data. This dll is then used by MetaTrader 4 trading platform to execute trades with the goal of making profits. To succesfuly train the ANN, historical data of given financial instrument have to be provided. For detailed documentation see:
